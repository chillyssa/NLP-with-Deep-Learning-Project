        "As a foodie and avid home chef I am always searching for new recipes to try out to expand my repertoire! The problem I face when turning to the internet to look for a recipe is the vast amount information available online. There are many professional websites as well as personal blogs both of which have their own subset of seemingly countless recipes, including different variations of the virtually the same dish. Each recipe then has a set of reviews and it's baffling to sift through the reviews of each recipe to determine whether or not I should ultimately test out the dish. I need a tool or method to quickly analyze a set of recipe reviews and give me some insight on the reviews and potentially the underlying reason why the recipe is reccomended or not. Enter natural language processing and sentiment analysis!\n",

        "Luckily data is everywhere today, including the food world. The intention of this project is to harness the power of natural language processing by way of sentiment analysis to examine a set of [recipe review data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) from Food.com's online recipe generator. This data set comes from Kaggle and was originally gathered for the below cited research. \n",

Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.

Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.

I lost my recipe & am thankful that you posted. Today I made small tartlets with this recipe & put almond filling & cherry pie filling in the bottom, spooned the cheese mix over the top & added sliced almonds. Baking time is about 20 minutes or so, depending on your oven. I also used Mexican vanilla. It is a great vanilla for baking use. The aluminum cupcake cups with the wax paper liners work great for sharing, once the tartlet is removed from the tartlet pans. I topped off with powdered sugar. The ladies @ the Cookie Exchange party I made them for were all a buzz with curiousity & they went like lightning. This is an excellent recipe and is really easy to make.  \n",
