        "\n",
        "As a foodie and avid home chef I am always searching for new recipes to try out to expand my repertoire! The problem I face when turning to the internet to look for a recipe is the vast amount information available online. There are many professional websites as well as personal blogs both of which have their own subset of seemingly countless recipes, including different variations of the virtually the same dish. Each recipe then has a set of reviews and it's baffling to sift through the reviews of each recipe to determine whether or not I should ultimately test out the dish. I need a tool or method to quickly analyze a set of recipe reviews and give me some insight on the reviews and potentially the underlying reason why the recipe is reccomended or not. Enter natural language processing and sentiment analysis!\n",

        "Luckily data is everywhere today, including the food world. The intention of this project is to harness the power of natural language processing by way of sentiment analysis to examine a set of [recipe review data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions) from Food.com's online recipe generator. This data set comes from Kaggle and was originally gathered for the below cited research. \n",
